The STL file and gcode are commit with the comment 'alternate casing'.
  
The casing has been created with great attention to detail, ensuring that it fits the components of the chips precisely. Despite the care taken in designing the casing, it has not yet been tested on a 3D printer. This means that the final product may still have some unforeseeable issues that could arise during the printing process. It is important to test the design on the printer to ensure that it can be produced correctly and to identify and resolve any problems before producing the final product.
