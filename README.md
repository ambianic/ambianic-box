# Ambianic Box

An Open Source physical enclosure for Ambianic Edge.

Ambianic Box is focused on creating an Open Source physical enclosure for an Ambianic Edge device.

The source 3D CAD file is currently [hosted on TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/iaHcZO7BVqD). 

An STL exported file is availble in this github repo.

# Project Goals

Its main goals are:
-  [ ] Easy to 3D Print and Assemble
-  [ ] Less than $10 for printing materials (PLA, PETG or ABS).
-  [ ] Under 5 hours print time with a common 3D printer.
-  [ ] Fool proof to mount correctly with the desired area of camera coverage.
-  [ ] Works well indoors and outdoors.
-  [ ] Easy to setup and connect to Ambiniac UI.
-  [ ] Easy to reset to default settings when needed.

# Project Status
